# Learning Go Data Structures and Algorithms [Video]
This is the code repository for [Learning Go Data Structures and Algorithms [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-go-data-structures-and-algorithms-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788392563), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Golang has been trending in the tech-world for the last 2 years with tremendous improvements to the language. Many developers and organizations are slowly migrating to Golang, adopting its fast, lightweight and inbuilt concurrency features. This brings the need to learn data structures and algorithms with this growing language. This video course will be your companion as it takes you through data structures and algorithms in Go, helping you get up-and-running as a confident Go programmer. 

You will begin by understanding the basic Data types and Structures in Go. Moving forward, you will learn the power of linked lists and doubly linked lists in Go and then learn to implement linear data structures such as stacks and queues. Also, implement binary searches and trees and will explore sorting algorithms in detail. 

From here, you will learn about graph algorithms and also be introduced to some common data structures used while working with strings. You will learn common techniques and structures used in tasks such as preprocessing, modeling, and transforming data. 

By the end of this course, you would have mastered functional and reactive implementations of traditional data structures in an easy and efficient manner.
